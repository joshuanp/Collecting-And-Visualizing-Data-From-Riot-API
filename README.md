# Collecting-And-Visualizing-Data-From-Riot-API

For this project, I collected my personal data from league of legends matches using the Riot API. After cleaning the data, it totals to 870 games. 
I visualized win rate, KDA, DPM, CS/min, multikills, total amount of first bloods, and objectives stolen. 
Dashboard is filterable by champion, gamemode, role, time, and patch version.

The dashboard allows answering the following various questions and more: 
* If I want to climb ranks the fastest, who and what role should I play?
* What role am I best at, and what role do I need to improve on?
* Should I focus more on improving my damage dealt, or killing minions?
* Am I able to get leads early by getting the first kill?
* How have I improved on this champion/role/gamemode over time?
* Who am I too agressive on, or not agressive enough?
